# CS154_Labs_2ndSem
This contains the code for my CS154 Laboratory course, including two graphics based programs in C++ and some programs in Prolog too (how cool is that ? :-))).

Some files within some directories will have numbers as suffixes due to repetition while download, these kinds of issues ... 

Also, not all files here are mine. Many were given by our professor as templates upon which we had to develop in the lab. Those original template files, or teaching materials, are also kept here.
