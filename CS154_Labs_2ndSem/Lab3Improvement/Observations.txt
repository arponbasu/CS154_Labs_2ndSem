The observations are:
No modification/improvement has been made to the implementations of the stack codes or the Vending machines.
Some improvements have been made to the 2pinGate and queue programs.
These were working fine before itself, just that a few modifications and extra features have been added.
In the 2pinGate, NAND and NOT gates have been added too.
In the queue problem, a circular queue implementation has been effected, which reduces the copying overhead associated with the linear implementation.
